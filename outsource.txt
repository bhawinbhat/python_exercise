Business Process Outsourcing Issues
Loss of control. Organizations generally have greater control on internal activities.
When activities are out-sourced, the vendor exercises primary control on day-to-day
activities, and any failure on the part of the vendor will directly impact the client.
Potential loss of organizational learning. Innovation and creativity are critical in a
knowledge economy. With out-sourcing, employees with critical skills may be lost
resulting in adverse effects on the ability of the organization to be innovative.
The outsourcing providers may hold the key to new knowledge and exploit it to their advantage.
Managing costs. In evaluating any outsourcing proposal, the management needs to
examine the sustainability of the perceived cost advantages in the medium to long term.
Short-term gains may be offset by long-term losses. Poorly drafted service
agreements can lead to unforeseen cost increases during the term of the agreement.
If the performance expectations are not clearly spelled out or market conditions change
unexpectedly, they may have serious implications on cost considerations. Many costs
are intangible, such as potential loss of organizational knowledge and are difficult to
quantify. There are also hidden costs such as the cost of managing the outsourcing
arrangements, which may outweigh potential cost savings.
Cost of mismanagement. Outsourcing is often a major organizational change with
serious implications for employee careers, organizational structure, and strategic
capabilities. If mismanaged, outsourcing can cause irreparable damage to the future
of the organization.
